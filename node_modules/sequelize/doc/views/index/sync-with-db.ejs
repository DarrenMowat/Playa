When starting a new project you won't have a database structure and using Sequelize you won't need to. Just specify 
your model structures and let the library do the rest.<br><br>

Currently supported is the creation and deletion of tables:

<pre><%- koala(".js", partial("code/sync-with-db/model-sync.ejs")) %></pre>

Because synchronizing and dropping all of your tables might be a lot of lines to write, you can also let
Sequelize do the work for you:

<pre><%- koala(".js", partial("code/sync-with-db/sequelize-sync.ejs")) %></pre>
